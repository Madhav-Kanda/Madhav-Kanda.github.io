## Projects

<!-- Project 1 -->
### [DeblurGAN](https://github.com/Madhav-Kanda/DeblurGAN)

This repository offers a comprehensive PyTorch-based implementation of the innovative research paper titled "Deep Generative Filter for Motion Deblurring," accessible at link. Building upon the original model, we have integrated cutting-edge techniques to enhance its performance remarkably.

The model is designed to take a pair of blurred and deblurred images as input during training and produce the deblurred image for the unseen image fed during testing. By leveraging PyTorch's capabilities, this implementation offers flexibility, making it suitable for various motion deblurring applications.

<!-- Project 2 -->
### [Compiler](https://github.com/Madhav-Kanda/Compiler-Project)

A Powerful Compiler Built from Scratch with Python, incorporating advanced techniques for lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and a user-friendly interface.
