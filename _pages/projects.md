<!-- Project 1 -->
### 1. [DeblurGAN](https://github.com/Madhav-Kanda/DeblurGAN)

PyTorch-based implementation of the research paper titled [Deep Generative Filter for Motion Deblurring](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017_workshops/papers/w43/Ramakrishnan_Deep_Generative_Filter_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf). Building upon the original model, we have integrated cutting-edge techniques to enhance its performance remarkably. The model is designed to take a pair of blurred and deblurred images as input during training and produces the deblurred image for the unseen image fed during testing. By leveraging PyTorch's capabilities, this implementation offers flexibility, making it suitable for various motion deblurring applications.

<!-- Project 2 -->
### 2. [Compiler](https://github.com/Madhav-Kanda/Compiler-Project)

A Powerful Compiler built from scratch with Python, incorporating advanced techniques for lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and a user-friendly interface. Incorporated advanced features such as error handling and introduced unique variable "var" for incorporating different possibilities of writing programs.


### 3. [AutoDiff-Inference](https://github.com/Madhav-Kanda/AutoDiff-Inference)

Implementation of Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) inspired Laplace approximation for constrained variables. The repository further contains the implementation of ADVI along with difference variants of Laplace approximation for comparison and research purposes.
