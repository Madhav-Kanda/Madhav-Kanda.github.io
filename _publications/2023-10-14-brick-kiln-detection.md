Identifying illegally constructed brick kilns will help mitigate their environmental impact. Due to the sparse availability of Indian brick kailn data, we employed transfer learning and fine-tuned the models developed for Bangladesh data. Labeling brick kilns is time-consuming; thus, employing active learning we labeled data points where the model exhibited the highest uncertainty. With the trained model, we identified over 700 brick kilns in the Indo-Gangetic region and we are further expanding this approach for other regions in India.
